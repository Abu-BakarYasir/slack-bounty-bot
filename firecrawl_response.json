It works great with documents with selectable text, but we'd like to:\n(1) improve robustness for non-selectable text (I think I've done this actually using the AI agent - but the selection boundaries are wrong)\n(2) check each signature with AI and validate that it is a valid signature (again I have implemented this feature and it's working mostly correctly but not populating some of the fields on the emails that need to go out)\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n1--> PDFs split correctly (i.e. each PDF in its own file, named for the numeric portion after the \"Number: \" field in the box)\n2--> Emails populate with the Delivered At: and Receiver: fields properly populated\n3--> Signature validation performs correctly as expected (i.e. blank signature boxes and single line signatures fail, others pass)\n\nTechnical Details\nWritten in python, with help from AI (um, mostly by AI...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[CM\\\\\n\\\\\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2732%27%20height=%2732%27/%3e)![cmcox](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1515aa3d7943dfc91b2468b2d5d41d5e?d=blank&s=256)\\\\\n\\\\\ncmcox](https://replit.com/@cmcox)\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¢2 hours ago\n\n\n\nNo applicants yet\n\n- $180.00\n18,000\n\nCycles\n\n\n\nTime Remainingdue 1 month from now\n‚Ä¢\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### [Help With Deploying Flask WebApp Game](https://replit.com/bounties/@leocheeseburger/help-with-deploying)\n\nI have created a game based on a board game called \"Sounds Fishy\". It is mostly written, with a few problems with it that need to be fixed, including the ability to deploy it. It's mostly vibe coded, so I guess you need to figure that out as well. It works similar to Jackbox games if that makes sense, but there are two or three issues that I would like fixed if possible in any manner possible. I don't mind you using any tools at all as long as the problems are fixed. I don't care about runtime or anything right now, this is just going to be used on a very small scale.\n\nThe game should be deployable on a server, with the problems below solved, and I might need a little bit of help connecting it to the domain that I have bought for it. I would also like the ability to update text files etc.\n\nTechnical Details\nThe project currently works when locally hosted but doesn't start up when deployed on a server like heroku.
